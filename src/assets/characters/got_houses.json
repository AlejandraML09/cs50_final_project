		"house": "House Stark",
		"descriptionShort": "House Stark of Winterfell is a Great House of Westeros and the royal house of the Kingdom of the North. They rule over the vast region known as the North from their seat in Winterfell.",
		"description": "It is one of the oldest lines of Westerosi nobility by far, claiming a line of descent stretching back over eight thousand years. Before the Targaryen conquest, as well as during the War of the Five Kings and early on in Daenerys Targaryen's war for Westeros, the leaders of House Stark ruled over the region as the Kings in the North. House Stark's sigil is a grey direwolf on a white background, over green. They are one of the few noble houses whose words are not a boast or threat. The House Stark family motto is a warning, one that, no matter the circumstances, will always be relevant: \"Winter Is Coming,\"which served as a reminder of their beginnings in the wake of the Long Night and a grim portent of things to come."

		"description": "It was briefly the royal house of the Seven Kingdoms until their defeat in Daenerys Targaryen's war for Westeros. The Lannisters rule over the Westerlands. Their seat is Casterly Rock, a massive rocky promontory overlooking the Sunset Sea which has had habitations and fortifications built into it over the millennia. As the new royal House, they also ruled directly over the Crownlands from their seat of the Red Keep in King's Landing, the traditional seat of the royal family. House Lannister's Heraldry consists of a golden lion on a crimson background, and their house words are \"Hear me roar!\", which are rarely mentioned. Their unofficial motto, which is as well known as the official one, is \"A Lannister always pays his debts\" - which is used much more often and mostly in negative context, though it can also be used in the original, literal sense."
